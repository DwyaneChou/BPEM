# BPEM
A Barotropic Primitive Equation Model
This model was written for study the atmosphere model, it might be a tool for researching the barotropic atmosphere.
The dynamic core description:

1. Barotropic primitive Equation in energy conservation format.

2. The complete coriolis and curvature terms.

3. Runger-Kutta 3rd order (the same as RK3 in WRF)

4. 8th order diffusion term to smooth the short wave.

5. Davies LBC scheme(the same as WRF)
