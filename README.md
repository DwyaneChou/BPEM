# BPEM
A Barotropic Primitive Equation Model
This model was written for studying the atmosphere model, it might be a tool for researching the barotropic atmosphere.
The dynamic core description:

1. Barotropic primitive Equation in energy conservation format or square conservation format.

2. The complete coriolis and curvature terms.

3. Time integration scheme: 3rd order Runger-Kutta (the same as RK3 in WRF) or original 4th order Runger-Kutta

4. Diffusion terms to smooth the short wave, it might be choosen from 0,2,4,6,8.

5. Davies LBC scheme(the same as WRF)

The details about running and installing might be found in Users'Guide.pdf
